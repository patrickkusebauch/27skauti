BDD TESTS
---------
The tests for this project are BDD test written in cucumber.
They require ruby to by installed. After you have ruby and bundle installed, you
can use the gemfile to get all other dependencies.

Once you have everything set up, go to these 2 files:
 - tests\features\support\hooks.rb
 - tests\step_definitions\database_steps.rb

And change the database connection (2x in database_steps.rb) to reflect your own.

TESTS WILL DELETE ALL DATA IN DATABASE AFTER EACH RUN!!

For that reason it is advisable to create a copy of the structure of the database
and test on the copy. Required data are loaded for each test separately.

There are test missing for "Hlasinek" section in both frontend and backend and
for picture upload in backend. The reason is I do not know, how mock existing
files.

While running the tests, you also have to make sure, that the file in
"app\config\config.neon" connects to the same database as the files above.
A good way to do so is to create a copy od "config.neon" and call it
"config.local.neon". Then update the `database:` section to look like this:

		default:
			dsn: "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=27skauti"
			user: 27skauti
			password: ***
			autowired: false
		testing:
			dsn: "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=27skauti_testing"
			user: 27skauti_testing
			password: ***
			autowired: true

Where `default:` is the default connection to the database with all the data and
`testing` is the connection to the testing database. You can switch in between
the databases by changing the value of `autowired:`. Only 1 of those can be TRUE
at the time.
The next change to make is in "app\bootstrap.php", where you change the name
of loaded configuration file.
